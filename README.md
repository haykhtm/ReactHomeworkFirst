◆ Make the decrease button disable if the number <= 0
 Add three inputs
For a maximal value that your counter can have
For minimal value
Step			
➔ Your app should have minimal CSS					
➔ All code should be pushed to GitHub and commit messages should be as descriptive as possible					
➔ ** Save all info in local storage so the app won’t lose information when you refresh the page
						



2. Create Unmounting count tracker
Requirements:
➔ Create react component (Wrapper) which will include simple cards with numbers and a report section, 
Each card should have(show) a unique number and close button
 When clicking on the close button, a card should disappear and “show” text should appear instead
 The Wrapper should have a report button, after clicking that button the report text should appear, telling how many times each component is unmounted.
